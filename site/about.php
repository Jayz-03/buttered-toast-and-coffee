                    Buttered Toast & Coffee began with a simple dream—delivering bliss in every bite and sip. Nestled in
                    the heart of Batangas, we’ve grown from a local favorite to a must-visit stop for specialty coffee
                    lovers and brunch enthusiasts. With carefully sourced beans from Sultan Kudarat and Kalinga, we
                    serve farm-to-cup coffee that feels like home, alongside a menu that speaks comfort and
                    satisfaction. From our signature croffles to hearty egg drops, Buttered Toast is where good food
                    meets great coffee.

                    decadent options like Dark Chocolate Almonds, Oreo, Blueberry, Strawberry, or Biscoff Croffles. If
                    you’re in the mood for a sandwich, our Egg Drop selection will hit the spot—choose from the Classic
                    Egg Toast with creamy scrambled eggs, cheese, and our signature sauce, the SPAM Nori Egg Drop with
                    roasted nori and spam, or the Ham and Cheese Egg Drop with chicken ham.
